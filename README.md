The task is about the differences in how annual members and casual members use Cyclistic bikes and insights on how to convert casual members into annual members. 
The data source used in this case study is from Motivate International Inc, under a public license. Since Cyclistic is a fictional company, the data is from Divvy, a bike sharing company based in Chicago.
